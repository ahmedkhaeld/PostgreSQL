/*----------------------------------------------------------------
Combines columns from one table with those of another
Take a column from one table that can map to the column of another table  
Join aggregate data from two tables, but it does it based on taking one column from One table that can map to the column of another table   
Most common approach? Link primary key to foreign key

*/

join the rows that match
If you have a columns that links the column from table A to table B you can use inner join
It finds the intersection of two data sets based on a link and it returns a subset
If table a has a thousand records and table b has a thousand records and we link employee no
From table a to table b, and itâ€™s a primary key to a foreign key relationship. And the intersection That find between both table will be showed
